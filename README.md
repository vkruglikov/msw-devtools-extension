## Overview

This Chrome extension simplifies working with [Mock Service Worker (MSW)](https://mswjs.io/). Instead of manually writing handlers, you can upload JSON files with mock requests, manage multiple configurations, and switch between them seamlessly. üõ†Ô∏è

## Key Features üåü

### üìÇ JSON Import

Easily upload JSON files containing mock request configurations.

### üöÄ Pass-Through Mode

Enable pass-through mode to bypass JSON config and send requests directly to the server
even if configurations are uploaded.

## Motivation üí°

This extension is a game-changer for both developers and QA testers working with [MSW](https://mswjs.io/). üßë‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª  
Instead of manually defining handlers for every request, you can now upload pre-configured JSON files, whether it's a single file or multiple files for different scenarios. Switching between configurations is quick and easy, making this tool highly efficient for various development and testing workflows. üöÄ

## Get started üöÄ

### Installation

```bash
npm install @msw-devtools/connect --save-exact
```

### Integrate to existing MSW setup

> We assume that you are already familiar with [Mock Service Worker (MSW)](https://mswjs.io/) and have
> set up your project to work with it. If not, please visit the official [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) website for guidance.

Just add the response resolver handler from `@msw-devtools/connect`

```javascript
import { http } from 'msw'
import { setupWorker } from 'msw/browser'

import { createResponseResolver } from '@msw-devtools/connect'

const handlers = [http.all('*', createResponseResolver())]

setupWorker(...handlers).start({
  onUnhandledRequest: 'bypass'
})
```

### Install Chrome Extension

Chrome Extension is not yet published to Chrome Web Store, because it's in waiting for review.

You can only install it downloading the build and [loading it as an unpacked extension](./packages/extension/README.md).

[![Download Chrome Extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/download-chrome_extension_dist-ff6a33)](https://github.com/vkruglikov/msw-devtools-extension/releases/tag/%40msw-devtools%2Fextension%40latest)

### Upload JSON Config to extension

[@msw-devtools/json-config](./packages/json-config/README.md)

### See the demo

[@msw-devtools/demo](https://vkruglikov.github.io/msw-devtools-extension/)

## Roadmap Features üöß

### Edit json config in the DevTools

Currently, you can only upload JSON files, but you can't edit them in the DevTools.

### Upload multiple JSON config at once

Currently, you can only upload one JSON file at a time, because
it simplifies the process of validation.

### Multi window support

Currently, you can use multi tabs with different configurations per host, but only one browser window is supported.

### Early request interception

Currently, requests sent before the extension is initialized are not intercepted by JSON handlers.
